What is a docker compose?
It's a templated docker container deployment software. It orchestrates bunch
of docker commands. It translates templated yaml file and turn them
into docker commands. It allows for easy version control deployment.
Deployment just becomes file centralized. You can check version history
of the file. You an create complex bash scripting with docker run commands.

Docker compose will always 2 things.
1. Version
2. services : These are containers basically.

a. tomact1 and 2 are containers.
b. the instance looks like name_of_directory_container-name
c. image and ports (host_port:container_port) are keys

Running docker compose checks for default docker-compose.yaml file.
If it has a different name, you can run in following ways:
#docker-compose up -d
#docker-compose -f yaml_file.yaml up -d

Enter the shell:
#docker exec -it dockercomp_tomcat1_1 /bin/bash
#ping dockercomp_tomcat2_1
#echo $TEST_ENV_VAR

You can use service name (tomcat1/2) or container_name(dockercomp_tomcat2_1)
