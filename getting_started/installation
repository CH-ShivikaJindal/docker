1. Get a docker toolbox.
Docker Toolbox is for older Mac and Windows systems that
do not meet the requirements of Docker for Mac and
Docker for Windows.

It's going to download install virtual machine on the
system, allowing a terminal to spin up, on the machine.

Following command executed in a different terminal will
let you connect to the docker machine. Here "default" is
the name of your docker machine.
#docker-machine ssh default


2. Hello World and Dockerfiles

# docker run hello-world
hello-world is the image name and docker first tries to
find local instance of the image. Name after colon is
called as tag. If you don't mention anything, docker will
default to "latest tag. Because it couldn't find
"hello-world" latest tag locally, it is going to pull
from default registry of docker.

Docker registry/hub: Bunch of managed docker images.
They are managed by account called library and image name.

#docker ps
Actively running Docker.

#docker ps -a
Shows all containers on the system.

#docker rm <docker-id> or <docker-name>

3. How would you build a container?

It requires a templated file. A docker file consists of
series of instructions/commands and arguments. You have a
base image, which is initial building block.

#https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/
c83a065a24e94e635ddd518c2a3cffc91accf30d/amd64/
hello-world/Dockerfile

"Scratch" is one of the multiple base images.
"hello" is a directory, where docker file is built.
copy hello directory into root directory of the container.
"/hello" is the command for running container instance.

4. Running customized docker file:

Whenever you want to run customized docker file, use
following command and give an image name:
#docker build . -t shivika-hello-world

The following command will run docker image. It basically
mean, we successfully built container image/hello-world
application.
#docker run shivika-hello-world

It is always recommended to remove any exited instance of
the container image.

SUMMARY:
You would create a docker file, include necessary base
image, have a command to run. Build the container, that
would create a container image and then using the image
name, you run an instance of it
