In this session, we will host our first docker container
webapp

1. Here we will create a directory named as "nginx"
2. We will create a small and simple web page file,
ending with .html extension.
3. We will also create nginx conf file, which we can
later customize.
4. And finally the dockerfile with instructions, FROM,
ADD, EXPOSE and CMD.
5. Once created, we will build the container with a useful
tag and run the docker container.
6. You can check status of the container using command,
docker ps.

If you want to run docker instance in background, as daemon,
run the following command with these options:
#docker run -d -p 80:80 webapp-shivika:latest
